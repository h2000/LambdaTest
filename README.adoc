Minimal Java8 Lambda enabled testing for TestNG (and later maybe JUnit).

== Motivation

When constrained to work in a Java-only toolchain, I really miss my ScalaTest.
I tried some lambda enabled test frameworks, but until now, I did not find a suitable solution.
Thus I decided to hack a really small and generic base class that basically allows me write tests easier.
I avoided to develop a completely new test stack,
so for asserts and the like the tools of the underlying test framework (currently TestNG) should be use. 

== How to write tests

Here you see a basic test example, which produces a TestNG test class

[source,java]

package org.example

import de.tobiasroeser.lambdatest.testng.FreeSpec;

class SimpleTest extends FreeSpec {{

  test("1 + 1 = 2", () -> {
    assertEquals(1 + 1, 2);
  });

  test("a pending test", () -> pending());

  test("divide by zero", () -> {
    int a = 2;
	int b = 0;
    intercept(ArithmeticException.class, () -> {
      int c = a / b;
    });
  });

}}
